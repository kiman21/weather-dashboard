# weather-dashboard

## Description

In this project, I built a weather dashboard application. This app calls data from the Open Weather API. and displays the data onscreen. I used bootstrap for a style framework and implemented fetch to fetch the data using the API key. Local storage saving, for loops, and if statements were also used in the javascript file.

## Installation

N/A

## Usage

To use the application, type a city name into the search bar. The application will then display the temperature, humidity, uv-index, and wind-speed from a searched city and a 5 day forecast from the same city. Previous searches will populate under the search bar.
